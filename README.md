Copy of this file should be on both the host, that want to communicate  with each other in LAN.

Application takes 2 command line arguments.
1) private IP address of the host you want to communicate with in LAN.
2) Your name, you want to show up with to other end user.

Note: Application make use of port 2000 for some personal reason, you may change it to wildcard port to always be able to run successfully.
for over the internet usage you have to set port forwarding to port of your preference on your router config.(That's why i hard coded 2000).
